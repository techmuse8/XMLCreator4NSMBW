# XMLCreator4NSMBW
A fork of a python program that builds a NSMBW XML file for you.

Originally forked from the release build at https://github.com/EterSky/XMLCreator

# Supported Versions
So far, only tested on the US version and briefly tested on the EUR version. Untested on the JPN version but should work. No support for the KOR or TWN versions at this time but may come later.

# How to run

In a terminal window, run `python3 XMLCreatorNSMBW.py` (`py -3` in substitute of `python3` on Windows) and follow the on screen instructions.
